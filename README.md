# Photo-Favorites
  This is a helper program for my photography workflow.

  On a typical photoshoot, I take hundreds of photos. In order to easily access the photos I like the most, I create a new folder called "favorites" where I put all valuable photos from the event. I usually toggle through the pictures and write down a list of my favorite photos. Once the list is finished, I select all photos from the list, copy them, and then paste them into the favorites folder.

However, when I have a lot of photos that I like, it can be a time-consuming process selecting them all.

This program is a GUI that allows a user to input the number ID of all pictures in a folder. The program will take all valid number IDs, create copies of the chosen image files, and paste them in a new folder called "favorites."
